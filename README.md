# Adverse-event-analysis
This repository contains an analysis of adverse event reports, exploring trends, co-occurrences, demographic patterns (e.g., sex), and product associations. Using Python and data analysis libraries, the project provides insights into the frequency and relationships of adverse events over time and across different groups.
